		<h1>FAVORITES</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"><img src="facebook.png" width="150px" height="150px"></a></h2>
			<p> Facebook is one of the website that I oftenly use. I use it for entertainment such as posting some stuff like memes. Also with Facebook I can use the Messenger that helps me to communicate to others. Specially because there is a pandemic going on our main source of communication is this. Thus I can say that I choose this because it is important to me.</p>
		<h2><a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank"><img src="telegram.png" width="150px" height="150px"></a></h2>
			<p>Telegram just like messenger it is one thing that I use as the form of communication. I mainly use this in my job. Actually I am not very familiar in using this but I still put it here. Because well it is one of the things that I use.</p>
		<h2><a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank"><img src="discord.png" width="150px" height="150px"></a></h2>
			<p>Discord again it is one form of communication that I use. This one is specially use in crypto games. Because it is hard to earn money this days I invest my time in playing crypto games. I mainly play Jobtribes because it doesn't need to invest money. And because the scholarship system is implemented in this game. I try my luck. We use discord as a form of communication </p>
		<h2><a href="https://animixplay.to/" target="_blank"><img src="animixplay.jpg" width="150px" height="150px"></a></h2>
			<p>Animixplay is a site where you can watch animes. As a past time I watch anime. But because I have many things to do I can rarely watch. It is one of the website that I choose because eversince I am a kid I watch anime. Like one piece, orange, and code geass</p>
